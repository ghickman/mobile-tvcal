Display a mobile version of your personalised tv calendar from pogdesign.co.uk

Mobile Tv Calendar includes a scraper file that builds an xml document. Ideally
this is run with a cron job a couple of minutes after midnight.

The Sinatra app will pick up on the xml generated by the scraper and build you a
mobile version of your tv show listings!

Changing settings on your pogdesign calendar will be reflected in your mobile
version once the scraper has been run again.
